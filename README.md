# backpropagation
Using Python, train a model by implementing backpropagation
I have followed the tutorial from https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/
It is broken down into 6 parts:
1. Initialize Network.
2. Forward Propagate.
3. Back Propagate Error.
4. Train Network.
5. Predict.
6. Seeds Dataset Case Study.
